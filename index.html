                        Hey! I am David, one of the co-founders of Happy Help! I
                        was actually the one that pitched the idea at one of our
                        fiserv meetings, so I find it really cool that we have
                        turned it into an actual website! I am in 7th grade,
                        just like Clarke and Shaas, and I love trying out new
                        things! I was the one that made the concept art and the
                        chatbot for Happy Help. I am so grateful that I made
                        this because of the opportunities that Fiserv has
                        presented me by letting me into their Future FinTechies
                        program! If you have any concerns or questions, feel

                        Hello! I am Shaas, co-founder of Happy Help, and I am
                        deeply passionate about coding websites, apps, and
                        games, despite being in 7th grade. Crafting the website
                        you are exploring has been a fulfilling experience, and
                        my time at Fiserv has provided invaluable insights into
                        the professional workflows of software engineering. For
                        me, coding is more than just a hobby; it is a form of
                        self-expression and a way to bring innovative ideas to
                        life. As I look ahead, I am excited to delve deeper into
                        coding, explore cutting-edge technologies, and continue
                        expanding my skills. If you are ever interested in
                        discussing tech or have questions, do not hesitate to

                        Hey there! I'm Clarke, one of the co-founders behind
                        Happy Help, a platform dedicated to making a real
                        difference. Witnessing our idea blossom from a pitch to
                        a fully functional website has been an incredibly
                        surreal journey. In 7th grade, alongside David and
                        Shaas, I've been immersed in the thrill of concepts. My
                        job for this website was to come up with a logo and
                        innovate ways to help others such as mental health care
                        that many people donâ€™t have. The opportunity to
                        participate in Fiserv's Future FinTechies program has
                        been nothing short of transformative, opening doors to
                        endless possibilities. If you would like to contact me,

                        communities to break the cycle of poverty, achieve their
                        full potential, and create positive change in their
